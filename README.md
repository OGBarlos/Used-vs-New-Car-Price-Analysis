# Used-vs-New-Car-Price-Analysis
Capstone Project for my BS in Data Analytics comparing prices of used and new cars using data sourced from kaggle.com. 

This project made use of tools like Anaconda, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks to condcuct the aggregation and analysis of this dataset.
  1) Downloaded original dataset from kaggle.com, loaded into jupyter notebook.
  2) Aggregated and cleaned dataset, getting rid of unnecessary columns and missing values.
  3) Saved new dataset and loaded into a MicrosoftSQL Server for further aggregation and column additions.
  4) Reloaded new dataset back into Jupyter Notebooks and conducted analysis, determining the top 3 brands and each brands top 3 models. Comparing the average prices of used vs new vehicles.
  5) Made visualizations via tableau public that covered the general trends in the data, while more specific relationships were explored using python.
  6) After analysis, developed a report and presentation that served as a caravan for the information that can be viewed by general and data-minded audiences.
